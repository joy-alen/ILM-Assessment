Big O notation is used for the analysis of the efficiency of an algorithm, by classifying the algorithm according to their time and space requirements with respect to the input size.

Big O is used because:
1. Complexity shown in terms of input size.
2. Machine independent.
3. Described in basic computer steps.
4. Describes the time and space requirements for the algorithm.

Types of measurements associated with Big O : 
1.Worst-case
2.Best case
3.Average case

Worst-case is mainly used when talking about Big O since it gives an upper bounnd on the resources requied by the system.
